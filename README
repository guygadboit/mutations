Introduction
============

This program adds silent mutations to genomes and reports on certain features
of where their BsaI and BsmBI enzyme recognition sites end up, counting how
many of them end up with a longest segment less than 8000nts long and which
have unique sticky ends.

It works by picking a nucleotide at random from the distribution it finds in
the actual starting genomes. It then tries to put that nucleotide in at a
random position to replace what was there. But if that would change the protein
it gives up and tries again. It keeps doing this until it's achieved 800
individual mutations, or however many you asked for.

Then it looks at the resulting mutated genome for where the BsaI/BsmBI sites
are.

It tries 6 starting genomes, which are all closely related to SARS-CoV-2:

	ChimericAncestor
	BtSY2
	BANAL-20-236
	BANAL-20-52
	BANAL-20-103
	RaTG13

You can easily add to that list if you want. You will need a .fasta file, a
corresponding .orfs file (you can look in one to see the format, and find the
ORFS by looking for the CDS entries in the genbank file).

The "ChimericAncestor" was constructed based on Figure 2 from this paper:

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04532-4

using RatG13 for the sections marked "MULT" (which happened to be the closest
out of those mentioned).

Building
========

./build.sh

Running
=======

Usage of ./mutations:
  -c	Count mutations per site etc.
  -m int
    	Number of mutations per mutant (default 763)
  -n int
    	Number of trials (default 10000)
  -p int
    	Number of threads (default 1)
  -t	Just do some self-tests

Example:

$ ./mutations -p 4

The more threads you use the faster it will finish since your computer probably
has a few cores (it takes about 10m to do 10000 tests for each genome with 4
threads on my computer).

-c will make it slower and is kind of work-in-progress at the moment for some
other things I'm investigating so I wouldn't use that.

Reading the results
===================

The program prints out some status while it's going so you know it's working
but the results all go into a file called results.txt which should have an
obvious format.

$ python3 analyse_results.py results.txt

To see the results.

There are various options for inspecting them in different ways:

analyse_results.py [-h] [-s] [-g] [-r] [-m MAX_COUNT] [-i] fname

The actual results
==================

Run with 799 muts (the actual distance between SC2 and the "Chimeric
Ancestor"-- the others are similar):

ChimericAncestor: 26074/32000 81.48%
BtSY2: 22663/32000 70.82%
BANAL-20-236: 12588/32000 39.34%
BANAL-20-52: 1641/32000 5.13%
BANAL-20-103: 12719/32000 39.75%
RaTG13: 14677/32000 45.87%

In other words, the Chimeric Ancestor had about an 80% chance of evolving into
an apparent artifical reverse genetics system, 70.82% for BtSY2, etc.
